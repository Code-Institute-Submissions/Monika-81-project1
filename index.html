               <h1>Who are we?</h1>
               <p>We are a relaxed group of curious, open minded and social beer-lovers residing in and around the
                city area of Helsingborg, Sweden.
                </p>
               <p>Five years back three of us decided we wanted to start a
                none-profit club for social gatherings with like minded beer enthusiasts (proudly known as geeks).
                Usually we meet at one of the local pubs to taste great beer, newly crafted or as old as
                Sven*, and to share our experience regarding taste, craftmanship, silly funs and facts.
                Occationally we even organize trips to local festivals, tap-take overs, seminars and
                so much more.
                </p>
               <p>Today our club exist of about 100 beer-lovers in various ages, from 19 to Sven*, and gender. Everyone
                is welcome, even the friend that doesn't enjoy the golden beverage but do enjoy relaxed and chatty
                company. We like to think we got something fun to share with everyone regardless of you prefer red
                ale, IPA, belgian sour, stout, chezh lager or a radler. We hope <em>YOU</em> will join us!
                </p>
               <p id="anecdote">*Sven is one of our founding members and he attends most of our gatherings. Why don't you
                come by and ask him about his age, to quench your curiousity and to break the ice!</p>
