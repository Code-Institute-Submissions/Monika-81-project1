<br>
<li> Hero Image <br>
As part of the main design there is a "hero image" to the left of the page a desktop and tablets with a screen at 1200px or above. The same image will transform as a header image at viewports the scale of 1200px and below. The image main purpose is to  work as a mode setter and in itself subconsciously get the user to associate the site with beer. Visually it will work as a complement to the text section but if the image won't load there is a background image in a contrasting color that connects to the color scheme of the entire web page.
